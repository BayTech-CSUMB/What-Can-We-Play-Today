# WhatCanWePlayToday

## Features

- **Steam Authentication**: Users can easily log in using their Steam accounts.
- **Room Creation and Joining**: Users can create or join rooms to collaborate with friends.
- **Game Recommendations**: The application provides game suggestions tailored to the preferences and game libraries of the room's members.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and intuitive interface ensures a seamless user experience.

## Supabase CLI: Login (Linux & Windows)

- **Purpose:** Use the Supabase CLI to run SQL against your hosted database (e.g., apply `supabase-migration.sql`) and manage the linked project. Docker is only required for local containers (`supabase start`); for remote DB work, you can skip Docker.

**Recommended (No Install): Use npx**

- **Login:** `npx supabase@latest login` (paste your Supabase Personal Access Token)
- **Link Project:** `npx supabase@latest link --project-ref rorwijbtoztlhdfcnbjo`
- **Execute Migration Remotely:**
  - Linux/macOS: `POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING` should point to your database URL
    - `export POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING="<your-db-url>"`
    - `npx supabase@latest db execute --file supabase-migration.sql --db-url "$POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING"`
  - Windows (PowerShell):
    - `$env:POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING="<your-db-url>"`
    - `npx supabase@latest db execute --file supabase-migration.sql --db-url "$env:POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING"`

**Where CLI Login Is Stored**

- **Linux/macOS:** `~/.config/supabase/config.json`
- **Windows:** `%AppData%\Supabase\config.json`

**Windows Install Alternatives (Optional)**

- **Scoop:**
  - `iwr get.scoop.sh -UseBasicParsing | iex`
  - `scoop bucket add supabase https://github.com/supabase/scoop-bucket`
  - `scoop install supabase`
- **Manual Binary:** Download `supabase_windows_amd64.zip` from GitHub Releases, unzip `supabase.exe` to a folder on `PATH` (e.g., `C:\Tools\supabase\`) and run `supabase --version`.

**Notes**

- **Do not use** `npm i -g supabase` â€” global install via npm is not supported by the CLI.
- The deployed app authenticates to Supabase using `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`/`SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` from your hosting environment (e.g., Vercel). The CLI login is only for your local machine and is not used by the app at runtime.
